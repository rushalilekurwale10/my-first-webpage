    <p>Online shopping is often considered better due to its convenience, allowing 24/7 access from anywhere and eliminating travel time and crowds. It also provides a wider selection of products than physical stores and enables easy price and product comparison, often leading to better deals, discounts, and cashbacks. Finally, access to customer reviews and detailed information helps shoppers make more informed decisions before purchasing.</p>
